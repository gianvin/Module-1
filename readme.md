# Overview

Create a program using Python Pandas for Data Analysis on Eduaction Data

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Item 1 I need to fix the length of my video
* Item 2 I need to practice more writing code to be fully familiar with it.
* Item 3 I will add creating graphs using Python Pandas.
